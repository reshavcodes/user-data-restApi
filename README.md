# user-data-restApi
A Rest Api with *Node Js* as backend.

This Api has `password authencation` for the `Update` and `Delete` methods, it requires that specific user's `password` to perform the action.

`Note:`
The getting specific user by id field requires their age instead of id (did it so anyone new to this could understand).


Give it a star if you find it useful.
